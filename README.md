- `middleware`: Contains custom middleware functions for route protection and user authorization.
- `models`: Contains the Mongoose schema definitions for the User, Fest, and Comment models.
- `public`: Contains static files, including images, stylesheets, and client-side JavaScript.
- `routes`: Contains the route definitions for the application.
- `views`: Contains the Handlebars templates used for rendering the pages.

## Models

The application uses three models: User, Fest, and Comment.

### User

- Contains fields for the username, email, password, profileImageUrl, and bio.

### Fest

- Contains fields for the festival name, review, rating, imageUrl, favSet, owner, and comments.

### Comment

- Contains fields for the user, comment, and festId.

## Middleware

The application uses custom middleware to handle route protection and user authorization. These functions are stored in the `route-guard.js` file.

#### isLoggedIn

- Checks if the user is logged in. If not, renders the login page with an error message.

#### isLoggedOut

- Checks if the user is logged out. If the user is logged in, redirects to the user's profile page.

#### isOwner

#### isCommentOwner
